# ‚ùì What Are the Top-Paying & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts?
**A SQL-driven analysis of remote job postings to uncover salaries, in-demand skills, and the optimal skillset for aspiring data analysts.**

## Introduction 

This project explores the **Data Analyst job market** using SQL queries on a job postings dataset.
The focus is on remote roles, highlighting:
- Top-paying jobs.
- The most in-demand skills.
- The skills tht pay the most.
- The optimal skillset that combins demand with high salary.

## Background 
As part of my SQL learning journey, I analyzed real job postings to answer:
1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs? (Remote)
2. What skills are required for these top-paying roles?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analyst roles?
4. What are the top skills by salary?
5. What are the optimal skills (high demand + high pay)?

## Tools I Used 
- **Postgres SQL** ‚Üí queries & analysis  
- **Excel** ‚Üí visualizing results  
- **Python** (Matplotlib via ChatGPT) ‚Üí charts  
- **GitHub** ‚Üí project portfolio

**üìà Chart:**  

![Top paying skills](/assets/top_paying_skills.png)  

**Insight:**  
- Highest salary listed: $400,000. This is far above market norms ‚Üí likely a data outlier or a niche executive-level listing.
- After SVN, the highest-paying skills are emerging technologies (blockchain, AI automation, NoSQL, modern programming). While not core analyst tools, they are highly rewarded when demanded.
- Salary insights:
    - Average salary across the table: ~$145k.
    - Median salary: ~$130k.
    - The ‚Äúfloor‚Äù of top 25 is around $115k (Scala), showing that even the lowest in this top list are still well above the standard analyst salary (~$90‚Äì100k).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Skills (High Salary + High Demand)
**By combining salary and demand data, I identified the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù skills for career growth.**

**üìÇ SQL Query:** [Optimal skills for remotly Data Analyst roles query](/project_sql/5_optimal_skills.sql)

**üìä Chart:** 

![Optimal skills chart](/assets/Optimal_skills_excel_chart.png)

**Insight:**   
- Demand is concentrated in generalist skills (Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI).
- Niche tools like Confluence, Hadoop, Snowflake add salary differentiation, but are less demanded compared to Python/SQL.
    - These skills are lucrative for specialists but not mandatory for all analysts.
- Best strategy = **Build foundations**: SQL + Python + Tableau/Power BI + one cloud/warehouse skill (Snowflake/Azure) **For advantage**.
